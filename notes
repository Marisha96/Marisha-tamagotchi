I grab the some elements from the section and using flex grid to set it up
it basically reminded me of flex frog examples

i am stil deciding the colors, of which i want to use, these colors may or may not be temporary.

Created functions in a different degree for the flags/cards to turn over
Made another function so that the flags can toggle back and 
front.


Making another function,
 so know when the cards is flipped and they 
 are equal they will stay flipped, if not they
  will turn back over.


i made my if, else statement, which shows that if fliiped two cards over 
it will either say match or wrong.


  i need to add a timer to so that it is timeout 
  by it self when being flipped or toggle.

I ALSO ADDED a timer to when you run out of lives, it restarts
the game and switches up the order of the cards.

added an alert to let you know if you win or you lost,
also set a timer on the cards so it flipped back within 
one second if flipped incorrectly.

when you run out of lives, the game resets and randomize.
