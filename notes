I grab the some elements from the section and using flex grid to set it up
it basically reminded me of flex frog examples

i am stil deciding the colors, of which i want to use, these colors may or may not be temporary.

Created functions in a different degree for the flags/cards to turn over
Made another function so that the flags can toggle back and 
front.


Making another function,
 so know when the cards is flipped and they 
 are equal they will stay flipped, if not they
  will turn back over.
